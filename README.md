### Development

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14 or above)
- [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/) (way better than any other node package managers)

## Getting Started

```bash
bun install
```

5. Start the development server with hot-reloading using the following command:

```bash
bun dev
```

6. In **Obsidian**, open **Settings**.
7. In the side menu, select **Community plugins**.
8. Select **Turn on community plugins**.
9. Under **Installed plugins**, enable the **Kenku FM Intergration** by
   selecting the toggle button next to it.
10. Once you're ready to bundle your plugin for **production**, run the
    following command:

```bash
bun run build
```



## Source mapping
To get the source map to load in Obsidian, and thus allowing you to see your Typescript code when debugging, you might need to set the 
**sourcemapBaseUrl** parameter in **vite.config.ts**. To actual path can be found by adding the folder (test-vault) containing your .map file to the "Filesystem" 
tab in the debugger. Right-click the map file and select "Copy link address". Set **sourcemapBaseUrl** to the base address.
